    "Looking at the elbow plot above, I decided that the elbow point seemed to occur around 140 clusters. After trying a few close-by iterations, I settled on 145 as the number of clusters. I thought it would be more useful for the algorithm to group things more narrowly, by closely-related products like 'ice cream' or 'cheese', instead of broad categories like just 'meats' or 'dairy' because I think in terms of seeing which kinds of foods end up being dangerous the most, it helps to have that more specific perspective (especially in figuring out what to avoid when I'm in the grocery store, lest I be unable to purchase anything at all!). Looking at the cells below as well, where certain brands seem to have more...problems than others, it could be helpful to down-select by that brand so as to avoid it in the future, just in case."

    "The following cell iterates through all the 145 clusters, where each item is separated by the stars ('***') and each cluster is separated by dashes ('---') and with the cluster number listed at the beginning fo the cluster. One interesting thing about the clusters is that the name of a brand such as 'Blue Bell' or 'UPC' pulled things into separate clusters, even when 'Blue Bell' actually fit under the more general heading of 'ice cream'. And with 'UPC' most of the items were nut-related, but actually varied slightly by specificity with that grouping, pulled together, I think, by the shared brand name. "
